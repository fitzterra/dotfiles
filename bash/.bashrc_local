# Local system config changes.
# This file is sourced from ~/.bashrc to make any local changes to the system
# environment that deviates from the default debian setup. The reason for this
# file is so that we do not need to edit any of the defautl system config files
# except ~/.bashrc. This means that the package maintainer's default config
# files can be installed without merging their new config changes to our
# local changes on package upgrades.

# Set vi key bindings
set -o vi

# First source any system wide local changes
[ -f /etc/bash.rclocal ] && . /etc/bash.rclocal

# Any further user specific local changes can be made here
export PATH=${PATH}:${HOME}/bin:${HOME}/.local/bin

# Source all *_rc files in .bashrc_local.d/ if it is present - can't use the -d
# test here because this should be symlink and not a dir
if [ -a ~/.bashrc_local.d ]; then
    for f in ~/.bashrc_local.d/*_rc; do
        source $f
    done
