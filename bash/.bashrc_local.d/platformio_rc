# Add platformio python virtual env bin dir to the path if it is found.
# This is if it was installed using the install script from:
# https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html#installer-script
#
# NOTE:
#  We leave this disabled otherwise it makes these changes system wide and can
#  potentially make the pio python the default if no other python is installed.
#  A better option is to use direnv to set this up for any project that needs
#  to run under pio.
#  This file can be copied to the project dir and renamed `.envrc` and then run
#  `direnv allow` in the project dir to activate this environment.
#  Doing so will enanle pio only while in that project dir.
#  Remember to first comment out the return statements below
