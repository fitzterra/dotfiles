Dotfiles
========

This is my dotfiles repo. I think I should have done this a long time ago :-)

Some really good resource: https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles

This will fianlly replace my easyEnv project started years ago: https://github.com/fitzterra/easyEnv


Usage
-----

Still a work in progress, but make sure `xstow` is installed, then run the
`install.sh` script to install/update all dot files.

Also try `-h` to see more install options.
